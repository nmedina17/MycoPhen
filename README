# Title
Code for: Temporal dynamics of ectomycorrhizal fungi: Leaf habit and exploration strategy explain seasonal variation in community abundance and composition

# Description
This code project repository includes qPCR and community data tables in the analysis/ folder. 

# File structure

This project contains the main folders: 
- stats/ for statistical analysis
- figs/ for 4 main figures and 6 supplementary 
- analysis/ for community analysis, where 'commEM.R' calculates diversity indices and 'ordEM.R' generates an ordination table used for graphing and statistics.

To generate analysis and figures, be sure to import from the analysis/ folder the specific files 'qPCRfullQC_EM.csv' for qPCR data, as well as  'ASVsITS2rarFull_EMF_commTbl.csv' for the species abundance data. 

Then run 'stat*.R' files in stats/ folder, as well as fig*.R files as needed figs/ folder.
Optional objects in analysis/commEM.R file help to subset focal taxa of interest.
